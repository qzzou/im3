# IM3 Tutorial - Remaining Tasks

## Completed
- [x] Create main HTML structure with navigation and styling
- [x] Build Unit 1: Polynomials & Polynomial Functions (with verbose solutions)
- [x] Build Unit 2: Rational Functions & Expressions (with verbose solutions)
- [x] Build Unit 3: Radical Functions & Equations (with verbose solutions)
- [x] Build Unit 4: Exponentials & Logarithms (with verbose solutions)
- [x] Build Unit 5: Trigonometry & Unit Circle (with verbose solutions)
- [x] Build Unit 6: Trigonometric Identities & Equations (with verbose solutions)
- [x] Build Unit 7: Statistics & Probability (with verbose solutions)
- [x] Build Unit 8: Sequences & Series (with verbose solutions)
- [x] Add "Generate More" problem generators for all Units 1-8
- [x] Refactor to unit-level files for maintainability

## Notes
- All solutions follow the verbose problem-solving mindset format
- Each solution includes: step-by-step breakdown, key insights, common mistakes, pro tips
- Problem generators create random variations with full solutions
- Each unit file contains: lessons, exercises (6 each), and generators (6 each)
